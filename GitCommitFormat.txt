Git commit messages should be formatted as follows :

VERB + CHANGES + LOCATION + (#ID)

ex : Added requirements 1,2 and 3 (#17)

If the commit message has the word "and" , or the like inside of it, it means that it probably isn't a very good commit!
Try to decouple your commit content to ensure this doesn't happen.

ex : if you create a new file and changed the content of another file, make these two seperate commits instead of commiting them at the same time. (Use git add)

Creating new branches prior to a commit isn't necessary but is useful for difficult-to-integrate features.
